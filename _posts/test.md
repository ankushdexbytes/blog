## What is window in streaming
Let's say there are events arriving at the source and applied operations individually on each event or on events of one micro batch. But there are many cases when you would want to perform operations over a subset off events and aggregate these events over a time interval.

> where **windows** comes in picture

 - It is a subset off events based on a time interval, so over a period of time you will have multiple windows.
