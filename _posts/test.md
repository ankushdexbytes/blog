 - Kafka Streams is a client library for stream processing applications that process records in kafka topics.
 - Kafka streams provides the high level DSL like KStream and KTable.
 - Kafka streams provide the wrapper around the kafka Producer and Consumer API's.
 - Kafka streams provide the Topology to describe the flow of the stream.
