Kafka Producer API allows applications to send streams of data to topics in the Kafka cluster. Basically Its a component of the Kafka ecosystem which is used to publish messages onto a Kafka topic.

When creating a Kafka producer client application, first need an object to represent the required configuration properties needed to start up a producer. There are three required properties, bootstrap.servers and both key and value serializers.
