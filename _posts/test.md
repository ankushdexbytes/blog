## Join Operation on Streaming
Structured Streaming supports joining a streaming DataFrame with a static DataFrame as well as another streaming DataFrame. The result of the streaming join is generated incrementally, similar to the results of streaming aggregations.

## Joining Stream with Static data
In a practical scenario, you won't be working with stream. Only many a times you are required to join the screaming data with other data sets back to our scenario.
