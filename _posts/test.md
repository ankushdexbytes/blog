# Handling Late Data Using Watermarking

## What is Late Data
The data is considered to be late when it arrives to the system after the end of its window. For instance let's suppose we've a window storing items for event time included in 2020-02-02 10:00 - 2020-02-02 10:15 interval. Any item having the event time included in this interval but that comes to the system after the window computation is considered to be on late. 

## But, Why Should  Care?
