When processing large amounts of semi-structured data, there is usually a delay between the point when data is collected and its availability in reports and dashboards. Often the delay results from the need to validate or at least identify granular data. In some cases, however, being able to react immediately to new data is more important than being 100 percent certain of the dataâ€™s validity.
