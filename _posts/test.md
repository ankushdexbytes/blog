## In programming we can distinguish two main paradigms.

 1. Imperative programming
 - Keeps track of state and manages change of state
 - Defines exactly how to step through the code. Order of execution matters

 2. Functional programming
-   Avoids keeping track of and changing state and mutable data.
-   Divides the problem into functions


## What is Imperative Programming ?

With an imperative approach, a developer writes code that describes in exacting detail the steps that the computer must take to accomplish the goal.

**For example:** if you wanted to multiply all elements in a list by some factor, in Java the solution would be a `for` loop that increments a counter variable until it is less than the list length - so you are telling the computer how to transform a list explicitly.

•	Modifying Mutable Variables
•	Using Assignments 
•	Control Structure Loops, continue, break etc

## What is Functional Programming ?
Functional programming means focusing on the functions in the program. So, in a sense, it gives you new capabilities to work with these functions. In particular, functions can be values that are produced, consumed and composed
