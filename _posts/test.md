Big data is a collection of large amount of data which increases in volume, velocity and variety. In this blog discuses the methods of using Probabilistic Data Structure in Big Data Analysis and primarily focused on **Bloom Filter** which decreased the space or time.

The conventional data structures and algorithm are not sufficient to manage larger and more complex dataset of Big Data.

## What is PROBABILISTIC DATA STRUCTURE
Data structures are nothing different. They are like the bookshelves of your application where you can organize your data. Different data structures will give you different facility and benefits.
