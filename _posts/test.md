## In programming we can distinguish two main paradigms.

 1. Imperative programming
 - Keeps track of state and manages change of state
 - Defines exactly how to step through the code. Order of execution matters

 2. Functional programming
-   Avoids keeping track of and changing state and mutable data.
-   Divides the problem into functions


What is Imperative Programming ?
Imperative means the statements which tell it step by step how to do the task you want it to do.
