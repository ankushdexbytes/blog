# How to create a surrogate key with Apache Spark

 **What does  Surrogate Key  mean?**
 A surrogate key (or synthetic key, pseudokey, entity identifier, system-generated key, database sequence number, factless key, technical key, or arbitrary unique identifier) in a database is a unique identifier for either an entity in the modeled world or an object in the database. The surrogate key is not derived from application data, unlike a natural (or business) key which is derived from application data.
 **Surrogate key in a Data Warehouse**: Surrogate keys are typically meaningless integers used to connect the fact to the dimension tables of a data warehouse. There are various reasons why we cannot simply reuse our existing natural or business keys.
