## Traits
Traits are a fundamental unit of code reuse in Scala. Trait encapsulates method and field definitions, which can be reused by mixing into classes.


> what the **trait** word means. The traits means characteristic, so if
> you have a trait with a few attributes that you can mix into your
> object and this object will does have access to those attributes.

## Kind of Traits:

 1. Thin Trait
 2. Rich Trait
 
 **Thin Traits :** The thin traits is very similar to Java interfaces like the most of the methods abstract not all.
 **Rich Traits:**
