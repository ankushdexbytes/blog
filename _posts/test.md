Data lakes allow to quickly consolidating various types of data in one repository. The data may come from numerous sources and can be logically related then stored in its raw form. The reason for using the Big Data Lake as a data repository is that it will allow collecting various types of smart grid data (structured, semi-structured and unstructured) such as, smart meter data, transmission monitoring data, and image and video data. Including image and video data of smart grids enables data mining in digital image and video processing applications such as, detecting physical attacks and deformations on power stations [17].

The idea behind a data lake is to have one central platform to store and analyze every kind of data relevant to the enterprise. With the digital transformation, the data generated every day has multiplied by several times and business are collecting this consumer data, Internet of Things data and other data for further analysis.
