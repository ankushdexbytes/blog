# Kafka
Kafka is everywhere these days. With the advent of Microservices, Big Data and distributed computing. Kafka has become a regular occurrence in architecture’s of every product. This is all well and great, but stripped down to its core, Kafka is a distributed, horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant commit log.

## Lets proceed with Kafka storage internals:
You have some basic understanding about Kafka. With reference to storage in Kafka, you’ll always hear two terms, Partition and Topic.

 ## Kafka Topic
 Kafka Topic caters the entire purpose. Kafka topics are really just a named feed or category of messages. One way to think of it would be to consider a mailbox. It's an addressable, referenceable collection point for messages that producers send messages to and consumers retrieve messages from. **Topic is merely a logical grouping of several partitions.**
