# Handling Late Data Using Watermarking

## What is Handling Late Data
The data is considered to be late when it arrives to the system after the end of its window. For instance let's suppose we've a window storing items for event time included in 2020-02-02 10:00 - 2020-02-02 10:15 interval. Any item having the event time included in this interval but that comes to the system after the window computation is considered to be on late. Thus the lateness can be defined as the item's arrival after the reserved processing time interval.
