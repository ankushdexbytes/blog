Higher order functions take other functions as parameters or return a function as a result. This is possible because functions are first-class values in Scala.

> The primary goal of this blog is to show how to write functions that
> take other functions as input parameters.

## what we see:

 - The syntax you use to define function input parameters.
 - Many examples of that syntax.
 - How to execute a function once you have a reference to it.
