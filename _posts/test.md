Big data is a collection of large amount of data which increases in volume, velocity and variety. In this blog discuses the methods of using Probabilistic Data Structure in Big Data Analysis. The application is primarily focused on Bloom Filters as processing of big data is a major challenge because big data is a continuous stream of rapidly increasing data. To have maximum benefit from data, a bloom Filter can be used so that usability of big data can be achieved while decreasing space or time
