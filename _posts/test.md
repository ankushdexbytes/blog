# kafka producer
Kafka Producer API allows applications to send streams of data to topics in the Kafka cluster. Basically Its a component of the Kafka ecosystem which is used to publish messages onto a Kafka topic.

Having knowledge of producer configurations becomes critical for us in order to get optimal performance and to leverage the capabilities of Kafka. Let's look at each of them in detail below:
