Big data is a collection of large amount of data which increases in volume, velocity and variety very rapidly. As a researcher, deriving values of importance from this large repository of data is utmost important and challenging. This paper discusses the methods for using Probabilistic Data Structure in Big Data Analysis. The application is primarily focused on Bloom Filters as processing of big data is a major challenge because big data is a continuous stream of rapidly increasing data. To have maximum benefit from data, a bloom Filter can be used so that usability of big data can be achieved while decreasing space or time
